# CARLA GUI Manager

This application focused on the Carla client can manage:
- Map selection
- Weather and time of day
- NPC vehicles

---

## TODO:
- Settings with customization
- Change physics with different weather
- Add arguments to connect to a specific port, now it only connects to localhost

---

## How to run

1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run Carla server
3. `python3 main.py`

---

## My Next project...

I'm going to build an ego vehicle and then display the sensors' information in one or multiple windows, possible with pygame or another framework.
